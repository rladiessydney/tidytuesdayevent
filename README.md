# tidytuesdayevent
this repository contains the code we created at our Tidy Tuesday event on 16/10/19

The event started with a demo of this week's data (the big mtcars dataset) from Jenny Sloane. You can see her [code here](/Jenny_cars_demo.Rmd)

We then broke into 3 group and each group tackled the dataset from March 2019 about [Seattle pet names](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-03-26)

Here is the code from each group. 

[Group 1](/pets1.Rmd) looked at whether the popular names were largely cats or dogs

[Group 2](/pets2.Rmd) looked at differences in cat vs. dog registrations by month.
